Atomic Design is a methodology for building user interfaces by breaking them into smaller, reusable components. In React Native apps, it helps organize components into a clear hierarchy:

    Atoms: Basic building blocks like buttons, text, icons, or inputs.

    Molecules: Simple groups of atoms, such as a labeled input field.

    Organisms: Complex UI sections made from molecules and/or atoms, like a form or navbar.

    Templates: Page layouts using groups of organisms to define structure.

    Pages: Actual views/screens filled with real content.

This approach improves consistency, reusability, and scalability in your app's design system.
